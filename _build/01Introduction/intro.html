<p>The goal of this project is to cover an end to end data mining project. Starting with collecting data and creating dataset and finishing with a web service that is predicting the output variable using a machine learning model that is being trained whenever the dataset is being fed with new data. The dataset consists of listings of used cars put on sale on the <a href="https://www.autoscout24.com/">AutoScout24 website</a>. We will try to predict the price of the car given each of its attributes. Before doing so, the dataset will be subject to numerous transformations discussed in the notebooks bellow.</p>
